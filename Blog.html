      <p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What makes video games so enticing and entertaining? This question is asked quite a lot by people who do not play video games. And there are a lot of different answers to this broad question; to some people it’s an escape from their lives and all the bad things going on in the world, to others a way to connect to friends and meet new people. For me video games are fun because I'm lucky enough to be able to play with my family and more specifically my cousins, without them I would barely play or maybe not even play at all.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gamequitters.com Summary: Games are a fun thing to do for lots of people, but there are many different reasons why people find them fun. For example one person might find video games fun because they enjoy the feeling of completing all the game has to offer, while another person finds video games fun because they get to do whatever they want without having to be required to do something that they don't find fun.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I fully agree with the review of Dark souls 3. Dark souls 3 is my favorite game for the challenge, Imagery, and the genius writing from Hidetaka Miyazaki. This game is a true 5 star game for me even the dlc is a masterpiece with one of the most challenging bosses Sister Friede coming from the ashes of ariandel dlc. Also arguably the most loved boss Slave knight gale coming from dark souls 3. This game will be very hard to top for me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Favorite Game Review: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/dark-souls-3-review-game-trilogy-hidetaki-miyazaki&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;3. For my dream setup I would pick a laptop because I go to a lot of places so having something mobile is very useful. The laptop I would pick is the MSI Stealth GS77. The reason I would pick this laptop is because it is a very high end laptop with crazy gaming capabilities that beat out most P.C. setups. It also has a very good screen. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SQ8NW1C/ref=twister_B09SQ98P98?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1&nbsp;</p>
      <p>4.&nbsp;Sports games We are in an interesting age of the sports genre where the market is controlled by money hungry companies that copy and paste the game every year. The games arn’t necessarily bad but when playing online a lot of things are locked behind a microtransaction that boosts your character or your team. The offline modes of sports games are basically the same thing every year with an updated roster. The player base is promised new things with most falling for the trap every year.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual reality is a simulated experience that employs pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment, education and business. virtual reality is a very enertaining form or entertainment, but I think within the future it will be used for a buisness as well as entertainment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>2.2. My favorite game of all time is Dark Souls 3. This is my favorite game because of the great scenery and extremly chalenging, but rewarding gameplay. The reviews for this game are all very high and fair <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dark+souls+3&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1081US1081&oq=dark+souls+3&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQzMDRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on">DS3</a></p>
